[entity-description]
mass-driver=Electromagnetic cannon used to launch payloads over long distances using electricity.
mass-driver-reader=Controls targeting and firing of the railgun.  Using circuit connections, provide ([virtual-signal=signal-X], [virtual-signal=signal-Y]) coordinates to target and [virtual-signal=signal-check] to fire. [virtual-signal=signal-dot] enables blocking mode, firing only when the destination is clear.
mass-driver-requester=A specially-designed chest that can withstand the stresses of being launched via mass driver without damaging the items within.\nPlace within one tile of a mass driver and fill with items.  Automatically loaded before firing.\n\n[color=yellow]Caution:[/color] items may shift about during transit!
mass-driver-provider=A payload delivered via mass driver.\nRequires reassembly before launching again. Automatically marks itself for deconstruction when empty.\n\n[color=yellow]Caution:[/color] items may have shifted during transit!

[item-name]
mass-driver-gps=Nauvis positioning system
mass-driver-em-armature=Electromagnetic armature
mass-driver-booster-armature=Booster armature

[item-description]
mass-driver-gps=Draws driver targeting lines while held.\nClick to save a position's coordinates.\nClick on a fire control computer to paste coordinates.  Newly placed computers will have the coordinates pasted automatically.
mass-driver-em-armature=Conductive carriage used to convert strong magnetic and electric fields into kinetic energy. Load into a mass driver to launch a payload.
mass-driver-booster-armature=Second-stage booster rockets decrease the amount of energy needed to launch a payload. Effectively reduces distance by 1000 meters, potentially allowing launching payloads without needing electricity.

[mod-setting-name]
mass-driver-provider-type=Payload chest behavior
mass-driver-use-milsci=Use military science packs
mass-driver-payload-mass=Payload mass
mass-driver-default-range=Base driver range

[mod-setting-description]
mass-driver-provider-type=Which type of chest to base the behavior of payloads after landing.
mass-driver-use-milsci=Whether to use military science packs for technology requirements. For use in worlds without biters where military science isn't researched.
mass-driver-payload-mass=How much mass to use for energy calculations. 2 tons corresponds to about 10 MJ per 1000 meters and usage increases linearly with mass and distance.\n[color=blue]Default:[/color] 2.0 tons
mass-driver-default-range=The range of the mass driver before upgrades.\n[color=blue]Default:[/color] 560 meters
